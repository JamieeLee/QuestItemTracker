# Changelog

All notable changes to **Quest Item Tracker (QIT)** are recorded **in this single file**, newest release first.

**Maintenance rule:** On every new release, add a section to **this existing `CHANGELOG.md`**. Do not create `CHANGELOG-vX.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES-vX.md`, `vX.md`, or per-version Markdown files. Keep `README.md` focused on what the addon does and how to use it. The addon version in `QuestItemTracker/QuestItemTracker.toc` must have a matching heading here.

## [0.2] - 2026-11-11

### Added
- Faction-aware quest filtering, on by default, with a minimap preference to show both factions.
- Detection for quest-giver-supplied items, quest-starting items, spell-use items, and other QuestieDB item relationships beyond ordinary collection objectives.
- QuestieDB handling for repeatable quests and cautious **REVIEW** treatment of uncertain event-linked items.
- Source-quest information for miscellaneous/quest-category rewards, including **Bloody Map** from **Open the Maw**.

### Improved
- Improved matching for **Crate of Ghost Magnets** and other items supplied for an active quest.
- Applied faction filtering to both displayed quests and item KEEP / SAFE TO DELETE decisions.
- Avoided false requirements for quest rewards and other loosely related items.
- Added automated Lua checks and an installable test ZIP artifact to the GitHub workflow.
